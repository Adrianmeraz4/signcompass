<h1>Lesson 1: Introduction</h1>
<h2>What is ASL?</h2>
<p>ASL or American Sign Language is a non-verbal language used by the deaf and mute community in the US. ASL uses a combination of hand signs,
<br> directional motions, and gestures to convey language and meaning.  Around 430,000 people In the US use ASL to communicate and now you can
<br> too. This introductory lesson will teach you basic information about ASL before learning any signs, the information is crucial still so
<br> pay attention.</p>

<h2>Static vs Dynamic</h2>
<p>In American Sign Language there are two types of signs: Static and Dynamic</p>
<p>Static signs rely on the use of the shape and direction of your hands and fingers and are typically reserved for letters, numbers, and simple
<br> words. This Introductory will primarily focus on these signs.</p>
<p>Dynamic signs incorporate gestures and movements with shape and direction to symbolize larger words or even strings of them.</p>

<h2>Importance of Orientation</h2>
<p>Verbal language uses several letters to compose endless combinations. The way sign languages approach this is similar, using the hand direction
<br> and fingers to represent the particular word. Just like the words brood and broad are only a one letter difference, signs do the same, the 
<br>difference between the letter A and S is the position of the thumb in the sign.</p>

<h2>Hand Direction</h2>
<p>The direction of the hand is of great importance, not only because it can change the word entirely, it also is crucial in the readability of your
<br> signs. Think of a limp wrist symbolizing a slurred word, it can be harder to read and understand if your sign isn't properly displayed. When 
<br>displaying a sign, your hand should be steady with your palm typically facing your listener and each sign should be completed and pronounced before
<br> starting the next</p>

<h2>Finger identification</h2>
<p>Throughout these lessons you will have instructions on how to arrange your fingers to produce the sign being taught. The Fingers will be labeled
<br> from Thumb to pinkie and your right hand to produce the signs. The Fingers number assignment will be shown below</p>
