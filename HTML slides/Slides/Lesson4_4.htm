<h1>Lesson 4: H-N</h1>
<h2>4.4 J</h2>
<p>True complexity in sign language begins with the letter J, one of the only 2 dynamic alphabet signs</p>
<p>To begin start your hand making the letter I. You can go back to the previous part for reference</p>
<p>You will then begin to make a circle with finger 5. Start by rotating to the right clockwise</p>
<p>When you start reaching the bottom your palm should now be facing you instead of outward where it started</p>
<p>Finally, when you bring your hand back up to complete the circle keep your palm facing you so you are essentially making an I sign to yourself</p>
