<h1>Lesson 4: H-N</h1>
<h2>4.7 M</h2>
<p>M and N are very similar symbols with a key difference, the position of finger 1</p>
<p>For M, your palm should face your listener and fingers 2, 3, 4, and 5 will be closed</p>
<p>Now put finger 1 between fingers 4 and 5  going behind the closed fingers</p>
<p>A tip for remembering M from N. Look at the fingers on top of the thumb. If there are 3 its an M and if its 2 its an N</p>
