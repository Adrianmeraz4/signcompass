<h1>Lesson 4: H-N</h1>
<h2>4.8 N</h2>
<p>As you can see with the example, N is extremely similar to N</p>
<p>To start, the palm faces the listener and fingers 2, 3, 4, and 5 are closed into the palm</p>
<p>This time finger 1 goes between finger 3, and 4 behind the closed fingers</p>
<p>Again, a tip for remembering M from N. Look at the fingers on top of the thumb. If there are 3 its an M and if its 2 its an N</p>
