    <h1>Lesson 2: ABC's</h1>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>Before we begin flex and close your hand a few times and make sure your fingers are good to go.</p>
    <p>Remember, your wrist orientation and finger position are crucial in sign making</p>
    <p>For this Lesson we will just be learning A, B, and C. At the end you will have a quiz and your first opportunity
        to attempt the camera
        <br>identification quiz where you can test your skills with an AI.
    </p>

    <h2>A</h2>
    <p>A is quite a simple letter.</p>
    <p>Your palm should start facing your listener as always.</p>
    <p>Close all of your fingers but leave finger 1 (the thumb) on the outside facing upward.</p>
    <p>Give it a try!</p>

    <h2>B</h2>
    <p>B can be seen as the opposite of A</p>
    <p>Palm facing your listener</p>
    <p>Fingers 2-5 should be pointing upwards side by side</p>
    <p>Finger 1 should be closed into the palm</p>

    <h2>C</h2>
    <p>Câ€™s letter is one of the few that is quite self explanatory since you will just make a C shape with your hand</p>
    <p>Unlike A and B this time your palm will face sideways</p>
    <p>Now finger 1 should go under and form a curve</p>
    <p>Fingers 2-5 will do the same but on top side to side</p>
