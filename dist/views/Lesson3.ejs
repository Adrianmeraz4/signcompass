        <h1>Lesson 3: D-G</h1>
        <h2>Before we Start</h2>
        <p>Before we begin flex and close your hand a few times and make sure your fingers are good to go.</p>
        <p>Remember, your wrist orientation and finger position are crucial in sign making</p>
        <p>This lesson you will be learning the rest of the first line of letters in the alphabet: D, E, F, and G. After
            this lesson, each lesson will be
            <br> an entire line of the alphabet and the quizzes will begin to be more complex. After this lesson you
            will be
            given the choice of a multiple
            <br>choice quiz and the camera identification quiz or returning to the main menu
        </p>

        <h2>D</h2>
        <p>Traditionally, the palm is facing the listener</p>
        <p>The letter d begins with finger 2 pointing upwards</p>
        <p>Fingers 3-5 will form a semicircle and meet Finger 1 doing the same from under and touch.</p>
        <p>This hand sign is also popularly done by facing the palm sideways similar to the letter C. This is an
            acceptable
            alternative</p>

        <h2>E</h2>
        <p>E can occasionally trick someone up with fingers 2-5, so read carefully</p>
        <p>Palm should face the listener</p>
        <p>Fingers 2-5 from the base knuckle (on your hand) to the middle knuckle(first bend on your finger) should be
            pointing up</p>
        <p>Then fingers 2-5 will curve point downward from the middle knuckle to fingertip</p>
        <p>The Thumb will be horizontally placed under fingers 2-5</p>
        <img src="\images\letterE.jpg" alt="letter E" width="150" height="250">

        <h2>F</h2>
        <p>F is similar to the “Okay” symbol except its fingers are side by side and the palm faces the listener</p>
        <p>Fingers 3-5 should be side by side facing upwards</p>
        <p>Fingers 1-2 will create a circle and meet in on the opposite side</p>
        <img src="\images\letterF.jpg" alt="letter F" width="175" height="225">

        <h2>G</h2>
        <p>G is a bit difficult to show with one image, so this one will have 2</p>
        <p>First, face your palm towards yourself and point your hand left</p>
        <p>Finger 3,4, and 5 will close into the hand</p>
        <p>Finger 2 and 1 with extend left and remain parallel with each other.</p>
        <p>Your 2nd finger (pointer) should be mostly blocking the view of finger 1 (thumb)</p>
