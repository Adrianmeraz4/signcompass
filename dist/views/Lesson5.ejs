    <h1>Lesson 5: O-T</h1>
    <h2>Before we start</h2>
    <p>Before we begin flex and close your hand a few times and make sure your fingers are good to go</p>
    <p>Remember, your wrist orientation and finger position are crucial in sign making</p>
    <p>This lesson you will be learning the third line of letters in the alphabet: O, P, Q, R, S, and T. After this
        lesson you will be given the
        <br> choice of a multiple choice quiz, the camera identification quiz or returning to the main menu
    </p>

    <h2>O</h2>
    <p>Starting simple, the letter O is another sign that is a recreation of its english letter</p>
    <p>First, your right hand palm should be facing left</p>
    <p>Next, similar to letter C, make fingers 2-5 curl around top and finger 1 in the opposite direction until the
        touch</p>

    <h2>P</h2>
    <p>P can seem tricky at first so read closely and observe the image</p>
    <p>First, extend your hand to the left with your palm facing the diagonal direction in between you and the ground
    </p>
    <p>Fingers 4 and 5 should close into the hand and finger 2 should extend outwards</p>
    <p>Finger 3 will also extend but go outward slightly down and towards you</p>
    <p>Finally, position finger 1 in between finger 2 and 3</p>

    <h2>Q</h2>
    <p>Preface for the image for the letter Q, the image is from the left side of the sign. Read the description for an
        accurate interpretation</p>
    <p>Q is fundamentally the letter G pointed down</p>
    <p>First point downwards with finger 2 with your knuckles facing your listener</p>
    <p>Fingers 3, 4, and 5 should be closed into the palm</p>
    <p>Then, extend finger 5 behind finger 2 and make it almost as long </p>

    <h2>R</h2>
    <p>R is a fairly popularly known and simple sign as many elementary schools use this symbol as a quiet way to ask to
        go to the restroom</p>
    <p>With your palm facing your listener close fingers 4 and 5 into your hand with finger 1 going over top of them</p>
    <p>Then simply extend fingers 2 and 3 with finger 2 crossing in front of finger 3</p>

    <h2>S</h2>
    <p>S as mentioned lessons ago is very similar to A in all ways but one</p>
    <p>Like A close fingers 2, 3, 4, and 5 into your hand with your palm facing your listener</p>
    <p>However this time you will put finger 1 over fingers 2 and 3. A small but crucial difference</p>

    <h2>T</h2>
    <p>T is also similar to previous letters, both M and N</p>
    <p>With your palm facing your listener close fingers 2, 3, 4, and 5</p>
    <p>Now position finger 1 between 2 and 3 to complete the sign</p>
