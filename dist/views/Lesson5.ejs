                    <h3>Cultural and Linguistic Significance of ASL Letters O, P, Q, R, S, T</h3>
                    <p>Each letter in American Sign Language (ASL) carries its own unique cultural and linguistic
                        significance. The letters O, P, Q, R, S, and T are no exception, each bringing a distinct aspect
                        to the language:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Letter O:</strong> The 'O' in ASL is not just a letter but a symbol of unity and
                            inclusion, often seen in signs that involve concepts of togetherness or wholeness.</li>
                        <li><strong>Letter P:</strong> The letter 'P' showcases ASL's creativity in using hand
                            orientations; its formation mirrors that of the letter 'K', representing the language's
                            innovative approach to manual alphabet design.</li>
                        <li><strong>Letter Q:</strong> The 'Q' sign, an inverted 'G', is a testament to ASL's dynamic
                            and flexible nature, where hand orientation plays a crucial role in creating diverse
                            meanings.</li>
                        <li><strong>Letter R:</strong> The 'R' in ASL, recognized for its crossed fingers, symbolizes
                            connection and interrelation, often found in signs that depict relationships or binding
                            concepts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Letter S:</strong> The 'S' handshape, a strong and firm fist, is symbolic of
                            strength and resilience, a theme that resonates deeply within the Deaf community and its
                            history.</li>
                        <li><strong>Letter T:</strong> The 'T' in ASL, with its unique thumb placement, often features
                            in signs that require precision, reflecting the language's emphasis on clear and detailed
                            communication.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These letters not only form the building blocks for finger spelling but also embody important
                        cultural and communicative values in ASL, enriching the language's expressiveness and depth.</p>

        <section class="asf-lesson">
            <div class="lesson-content">
                <h2>Letter O</h2>
                <p>The 'O' in ASL is formed by bringing all fingers together and touching the thumb to the fingertips,
                    creating a circular shape. This sign visually resembles the letter 'O' and is straightforward but
                    requires a clear and distinct formation.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Hand Position:</strong> Start with your hand open, palm facing yourself, fingers
                        slightly apart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forming the Circle:</strong> Curl your fingers towards your palm and touch your thumb to
                        the tips of your fingers. The fingers should come together to form a circle or 'O' shape.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ensure Clarity:</strong> Make sure the circle is complete with no gaps between the thumb
                        and fingers. The shape should be round and visible, clearly representing the letter 'O'.</li>
                    <li><strong>Steady Hand:</strong> Keep your hand steady while forming the 'O' to maintain the
                        shape's integrity. The sign should be held at eye level for visibility.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Practicing the 'O' sign is important for its universal use in finger spelling. Repeat the formation
                    several times to ensure it's easily recognizable and distinct.</p>

        <section class="asf-lesson">
            <div class="lesson-content">
                <h2>Letter P</h2>
                <p>The 'P' in ASL is a mirrored version of the letter 'K'. It involves extending the middle and index
                    fingers to create a right angle, with the thumb extended between them, and then turning the hand so
                    that the palm is facing downwards.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Hand Position:</strong> Start with your hand open, palm facing sideways, and
                        fingers spread apart.</li>
                    <li><strong>Index and Middle Fingers:</strong> Raise your index and middle fingers while keeping
                        them together. Then, split them to form a right angle, with the index finger pointing upwards
                        and the middle finger pointing forward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thumb Positioning:</strong> Place your thumb up between the index and middle fingers,
                        touching the middle segment of the middle finger. The thumb acts as a support, maintaining the
                        right angle position.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curling Other Fingers:</strong> Curl your ring and pinky fingers into your palm. They
                        should be held firmly against the palm, out of sight, to highlight the shape of the 'P'.</li>
                    <li><strong>Orientation:</strong> Rotate your hand so that the palm faces downwards, maintaining the
                        right angle and thumb position. This orientation is crucial to represent the letter 'P'
                        correctly.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ensure Clarity:</strong> Maintain the right angle and thumb positioning clearly. The
                        hand should be steady, and the sign held at eye level for visibility.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Practice the 'P' sign multiple times to ensure precision. This letter, with its unique hand
                    orientation, is an essential part of the ASL alphabet.</p>

                <h2>Letter Q</h2>
                <p>The 'Q' in ASL is similar to the 'G' sign but with a different orientation. It involves pointing the
                    index finger downward while the thumb extends outward, and the remaining fingers are curled into the
                    palm.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Hand Position:</strong> Start with your hand open, palm facing down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Index Finger Extension:</strong> Extend your index finger straight down, pointing
                        towards the ground.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thumb Positioning:</strong> Extend your thumb outwards, perpendicular to the index
                        finger.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curling Other Fingers:</strong> Curl your middle, ring, and pinky fingers into your
                        palm. Ensure they are tightly held to avoid confusion with other signs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hand Orientation:</strong> Turn your hand so that your palm faces sideways, maintaining
                        the extended thumb and pointed index finger.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ensure Clarity:</strong> Keep the 'Q' sign clear by maintaining the downward direction
                        of the index finger and the outward position of the thumb. The hand should be steady, and the
                        sign held at a comfortable level for visibility.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Practicing the 'Q' sign is crucial for its distinct orientation and structure. Repeat the formation

                <h2>Letter R</h2>
                <p>The 'R' in ASL is formed by crossing the index and middle fingers, similar to the common gesture for
                    'good luck' or 'crossing fingers.' The thumb is kept alongside the palm while the other fingers are
                    curled in.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Hand Position:</strong> Begin with your hand open, fingers extended, and palm
                        facing forward.</li>
                    <li><strong>Crossing Fingers:</strong> Cross your index finger over your middle finger. The crossing
                        should be near the base of the fingers, not at the tips.</li>
                    <li><strong>Thumb Position:</strong> Keep your thumb in its natural position, resting alongside your
                        palm. It should not be extended or overly pronounced.</li>
                    <li><strong>Curling Other Fingers:</strong> Curl your ring and pinky fingers into your palm. They
                        should be held tightly to avoid confusion with other signs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ensure Clarity:</strong> Make sure the crossing of the index and middle fingers is

                <h2>Letter S</h2>
                <p>The 'S' in ASL is made by forming a fist with the thumb placed across the front of the curled
                    fingers. This sign is similar to the universal sign for a fist or strength, but the position of the
                    thumb is crucial for it to represent the letter 'S'.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Initial Hand Position:</strong> Start with your hand open, palm facing yourself, and
