                    <h3>Numbers in American Sign Language (ASL): A Blend of Simplicity and Complexity</h3>
                    <p>Numbers in American Sign Language (ASL) showcase the language's balance of simplicity and
                        complexity, combining straightforward handshapes with nuanced movements. Let's explore some
                        unique and interesting aspects of ASL numbers:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>General Simplicity:</strong> Numbers 1 through 5 in ASL are represented with a
                            straightforward count of fingers, mirroring their use in many global cultures. This
                            simplicity makes them easily recognizable and universally understood.</li>
                        <li><strong>Unique Handshapes for 6-9:</strong> The numbers 6 through 9 in ASL are notable for
                            their inventive handshapes, where the thumb touches different fingers to represent each
                            number. This feature illustrates the efficiency and creativity inherent in ASL.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dynamic Sign for 10:</strong> The number 10 is unique in ASL as it involves movement
                            â€“ the thumb flicking off the side of the index finger. This dynamic element adds a level of
                            visual interest and distinctiveness to the sign.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> In ASL, numbers can be signed with a single hand, making
                            it a highly efficient system. This efficiency is particularly advantageous in settings where
                            one hand is occupied, such as holding an item or during multitasking.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The numbering system in ASL reflects the language's ingenuity, blending ease of use with
                        expressive handshapes and movements. It exemplifies the practical and visually engaging nature
                        of ASL.</p>

                <!-- Instruction for Number 100 -->
                <p><strong>Number 100:</strong> Sign '100' by first signing the number '1', which is done by extending
                    the index finger while keeping the rest of the fingers curled into the palm and the thumb resting
                    alongside the palm. Follow this by signing a 'C' handshape, representing 'century' or 'hundred'. The
                    'C' handshape is made by curving all fingers and the thumb to form a 'C'.</p>

                <!-- Encouragement and Instructions for Higher Numbers -->
                <p>Congratulations on learning ASL numbers from 1 to 100! For numbers beyond 100, ASL typically uses a
                    combination of the base number followed by the sign for 'hundred', 'thousand', or 'million', as
                    needed. For instance, '200' would be signed as '2' followed by the 'C' handshape for 'hundred', and
                    similarly for higher numbers. Keep practicing to master these higher numbers in ASL.</p>
