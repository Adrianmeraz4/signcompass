<h1>Lesson 7: Numbers</h1>
<h2>Before we start</h2>
<p>Before we begin flex and close your hand a few times and make sure your fingers are good to go</p>
<p>Remember, your wrist orientation and finger position are crucial in sign making</p>
<p>This lesson you will be learning the Numbers 1-10. After this lesson you will be given the
<br> choice of a multiple choice quiz, the camera identification quiz or returning to the main menu</p>

<h2>1</h2>
<p>All numbers will have your palm facing  your listener</p>
<p>Starting with number 1, close fingers 1, 3, 4, and 5 with 1 resting on top of 3</p>
<p>Lastly, point finger 2 straight upwards to complete the sign</p>

<h2>2</h2>
<p>Similar to number 1, 2 closes fingers 1, 4, and 5 with finger 1 resting on 4</p>
<p>Next make a V with fingers 2 and 3 to complete the sign</p>

<h2>3</h2>
<p>Following the pattern 3 had fingers 4 and 5 closed to start</p>
<p>Fingers 1, 2, and 3 will all protrude outward in their respective directions</p>

<h2>4</h2>
<p>The number 4 slightly changes the pattern</p>
<p>For 4 you will close only finger 1 into your hand</p>
<p>Fingers 2, 3, 4, and 5 will protrude upward</p>

<h2>6</h2>
<p>Unlike 1-5, numbers 6-10 don't represent the number using the number of fingers</p>
<p>6 starts with fingers 1 and 5 closed and resting on one another</p>
<p>Lastly, fingers 2, 3, and 4 are protruding upwards</p>

<p>Number 7 starts with fingers 1 and 4 closed into the palm</p>
<p>Fingers 2, 3, and 5 then protrude upwards to finish the sign</p>

<h2>9</h2>

<h2>10</h2>
<p>10 is the only dynamic number in the first ten numbers</p>
<p>To sign 10 close fingers 2, 3, 4, and 5 and face the long flat part of your knuckles towards your listener</p>
<p>Then bring finger 1 upwards and rotate the hand lightly left and right</p>
