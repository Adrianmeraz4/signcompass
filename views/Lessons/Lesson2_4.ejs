<h1>Lesson 2: ABC's</h1>
<h2>2.4 C</h2>
<p>Câ€™s letter is one of the few that is quite self explanatory since you will just make a C shape with your hand</p>
<p>Unlike A and B this time your palm will face sideways</p>
<p>Now finger 1 should go under and form a curve</p>
<p>Fingers 2-5 will do the same but on top side to side</p>
